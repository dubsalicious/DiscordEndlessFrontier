.acr !artifacttrans %user% typed `!artifacttrans`. This is an advanced guide that requires some understanding.

Artifact Transcendence significantly increases the power of 5\*/6\*/7\* artifacts.
Upon Transcending, materials are consumed and random artifact you own is transcended. Bonuses and maximum level of artifact are increased, as well as set bonus if you have enough transcended artifacts inside a set. You can only Transcend 1 artifact a day.

Transcending 5\* artifacts is a waste and not covered by this guide.

You need 20 6\* artifacts to begin transcending. Transcendence 1 rises limit of increasing maximum level of artifact to level 70\*\*.

You need 44 t1 6\* artifacts to begin transcending them to t2. Trancendence 2 rises limit of increasing maximum level of artifact to level 90\*\*

You need 15 7\* artifacts to begin transcending them. Trancendence 1 rises limit of increasing maximum level of artifact to level 100 \*\*

There is no ability to t2 7\* artifacts yet.
