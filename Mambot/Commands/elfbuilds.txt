Windwalker Elementalist Alch/Elementalist (5)   Priest (5)

**Example Core 2 Builds (Icy, Tinkey 5\*)**

```
Windwalker Hippogriff   Hippogriff (9)          Fairy
```
**Notes**

 - Hippogriff becomes better core than Elementalist with Ancient Outland's Blunt Froce at +92 or higher(see !art 89 in #book).
 - Supports should only have a minority of medals and generally aim for good breakpoints that benefit the whole team.
 - Please see this page on reddit for more information on breakpoints - <http://bit.ly/2lvOGKK>
 - Some more detailed builds can be found using !elfbuildold1 and !elfbuildold2, however these aren't recently updated.
