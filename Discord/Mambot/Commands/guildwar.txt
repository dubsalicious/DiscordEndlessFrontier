**Overview**

Guild Wars is a non-realtime pvp activity with consistent seasonal ranking among servers. 
2 wars are opened daily at 09:00, 2 more at 21:00 UTC, and last for 24 hours. Members have 2 tickets to attack and 2 to defend per war. Guild that won more flags wins, in case of a draw lower ranked guild wins.
Winning a battle rewards attacker with 20 :ef_gem:, and :ef_gc: are awarded to all participats, even if the war is lost. Win provides more :ef_gc: and improves guild ranking, which determines bonus to medals obtained that all guild members resieve.

**Defending and Attacking**
Players have 2 flags that can be taken by attackers and can select a team of 5 units, plus plebs, to attack with. These plebs come from the Guild barracks. Any player attacked gets 10 minutes of immunity from attack.

Upon being attacked, your Defense Team will spawn, supported by the lowest available group of 40 barracks units of corresponding tribe.

Unit strength is determined by KLVL.
