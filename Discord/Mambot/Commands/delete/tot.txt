.acr "!tot" You typed `!tot`. This provides a rough overview of which units to transcend for use in the Tower of Trials and Spirit Highlands. 

The Tower of Trials resets every 3 days and contains 32 stages providing a total of 500 gems and 1290 honor coins if completed. Each server has a different ToT.

__**Recommend Units**__

The below 2 sections cover which units are most useful to senior/transcend to help clear the ToT. All \* levels are AFTER being seniored. If stuck refer to this list to find good units to Transcend

**4\* Units and Below** - Strongest units higher in each list

*Essential*
```
Skeleton Warrior
Orc Hunter
Hammer Knight
Great Hammer Unit
```
*Often Useful*
```
Orc Fighter
Heavy Infantry
Warlock
```
*Sometimes handy*
```
Orc Wing OR Fire Bird
Frost Mage
Orc Hammer Unit
Elf Warrior
Infantry
Poison Archer
```
**5\* Units and Above**

5\* Units Allowed - If struggling, a transcended unit at 4\* will be as powerful, if not more so, than vanilla 5\* units.
6\* Units Allowed - Generally use the most powerful core/support units available, however a Senior Golem (and to a lesser extend Big Foot) can be useful.
