.acr "!stagemedalcalc" %user% typed `!stagemedalcalc`. This is a basic guide to working out your total medal gain for a revival.

You need to know 2 pieces of information:

 - The `MedalReward` for the stage you're reviving on, see`!stagemedal1`, `!stagemedal2` ,`!stagemedal3`, up to `!stagemedal9` for this.
 - Your MedalBonus from artifact sets, trans units and such. This is displayed on the revival screen as a percentage in blue writing.

Plug these into this formula  `MedalReward + (MedalReward * (MedalBonus/100))`

For example, reviving at Stage 2000 with a 800% buff `50100 + (50100 * 8) = 450900`
