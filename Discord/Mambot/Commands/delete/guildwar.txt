**Overview**

Guild Wars is a non-realtime pvp activity with consistent seasonal ranking among servers. 
2 wars are opened daily at 09:00, 2 more at 21:00 UTC, and last for 24 hours. Members have 2 tickets to attack and 2 to defend per war. Guild that won more flags wins, in case of a draw lower ranked guild wins.
Winning a battle rewards attacker with 20 :ef_gem:, and :ef_gc: are awarded to all participats, even if the war is lost. Win provides more :ef_gc: and improves guild ranking, which determines bonus to medals obtained that all guild members resieve.

**Defending and Attacking**
Attacker can chose who to attack, among people who have at least 1 flag remaining, select up to 5 Heros for attack and troops from barracks to support them, similar to guild raid.
Despite the result, defender recieves 10 minute immunity from attacks to replenish his troops. If attacker wins, defender's flag is taken. If defender wins, no change in flags occure.

Defending is automated. Upon being attacked, your Defense Team will spawn, supported by the lowest available group of 40 barracks units of corresponding tribe.

Similar to raid, troops stats mainly defined by Knightage Levels of defender and attacker.

Example defence team:
```
Golem         Druid       Valkyrie       Naga       Dark Admiral    
```

Example attack team:
```
Sword Dancer  Dark Ninja  Wyvern Rider  Steampunk   Battle Drummer
```
