.acr "!revivalteam" You typed `!revivalteam`. This guide provides a list of recommendations for the revival team.

The revival team allows a different squad to be used to provide revival buffs. This squad does *NOT* replace the main team in anyway, it is just used for those buffs. 

__**Dark Archer**__ 

The initial goal for the revival team is to maximise the Dark Archer revival buff at 60%:
```
Revival Team, 5* DA       - 2.5%
Revival Team, 6* DA       - 5.0%
Time Shop, 5* Moon, 5* DA - 1.0%
Time Shop, 5* Moon, 6* DA - 2.5%
```
Initially 12 Senior (6\*) Dark Archers in the revival team are needed. Once Moon reaches 5\* Dark Archers can be removed from the Revival Team, as long as the Revival Team + Time Shop total makes 60%.

Spaces in the Revival Team should be made using the units listed in the following section. The final goal is 12 T3 Shadow Knights with Shadow at 5\*.

__**Unit Medal Buffs**__

*Don't forget to add the Transcend Bonus onto the passive to get the total buff for an individual unit*.
