.acr !artifactbuilds %user% typed `!artifactbuilds`. This covers a selection of the most common artifact builds people use. It relies on having the full 27 slots and all 6\* artifacts so is aimed at MidGame.

The guide will reference upgrading certain artifacts. These are recommendation for upgrading to their maximum level using honor coins (+50 for 6\*, +70 for 6\* T1, +90 for 6\* T2).

__**6\* / 6\* T1 Builds**__
```
6  | Can be any tribe units, but Orc and
6  | Elf are probably recommended.
4  King of Beasts
4  Ancient Outland Beasts
4  Legacy of Abundance
3  The Ruler of Darkness
```
**Recommended Upgrade**
One each of Quest Upgrade Cost and Quest Open Gold Reduction should be enough. Additionally a Quest Gold Acquisition if needed.

These should ideally be from Frost Knight set because currently Orc is the most commonly used race late game. Elf is also a good choice.
 
 __**6\* T2 Guilds**__
``` 
6  | Can be any tribe units, but Orc, 
6  | Elf and one other are probably
6  | recommended.
4  King of Beasts
4  Legacy of Abundance
1  Ancient Outland Beast's Blunt Force
 ```
**Recommended Upgrade Order**
 - Ancient Outland Beast's Blunt Force
 - Additional Quest Upgrade Cost, Quest Open Gold Reduction and Quest Gold Acquisition. One of which should also boost your primary Tribe's attack power.
 - Additional Tribe Attack Power
 - Additional Economy artifacts as needed. Probably Quest Upgrade Cost, Quest Open Gold then Quest Gold ACquisition.

 __**Upgrade Costs :ef_hc:**__
 
20 -> 50 = 11,200 
50 -> 70 = 14,400
70 -> 90 = 14,400
90 -> 130 = 60,000 (Requires Raid 3 Pets)
