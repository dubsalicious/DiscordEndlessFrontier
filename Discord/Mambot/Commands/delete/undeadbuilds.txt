**Example Core 2 Builds (Icy, Tinkey 5\*)**

```
Dark Elf    Dark Spirit   Dark Elf (9)           Fairy
```
**Notes**

 - Dark Spirit supports make your team faster, but Dark Elf supports make your team go further due to tribe friendliness.
 - Supports should only have a minority of medals and generally aim for good breakpoints that benefit the whole team.
 - Please see this page on reddit for more information on breakpoints - <http://bit.ly/2lvOGKK>

__**Late Game Build**__
Crow Knight as core, Abyss as half-core. This is a "base" build. Adjust accordingly to tablets you have. It's generally worth to start swapping past 3\* tablets for ap and crit, but in some cases even 2\* tablet will be enough. 
```
Crow Knight   Abyss Mage   Abyss Mage(3)   Fairy(2)   Crow Knight(5)
```
To sucessfully run it over orc, you need Chesher, Cerbero and Raven in addition to core pets.
