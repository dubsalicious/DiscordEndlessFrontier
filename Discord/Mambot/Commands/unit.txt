Trigger: !unit

Content:

This provides an overview of how to purchase all units.

Most units can be bought with :ef_medal:, the __**exceptions**__ are the 8 following units:

Available from __Honor Shop__ for :ef_hc: 4400 
```
Flame Sibyl       Human
Mystic Archer     Elf 
Skeleton General  Undead
Frozen Witch      Orc
```
Available from __Unit Shop__  for :ef_gem: 5700
```
Fire Range        Human
Forest Knight     Elf
Devil Mage        Undead
Storm Warrior     Orc 
```
**It is probably unwise for new players to purchase units from the above list until they have a good enough understanding of the game to realise what is valuable**.

When the next units are released they will be in the honor shop. The current honor units become available for gems and the current gem units become available for medals.

**Any 5-star unit without exception can appear in 5-star Voucher**

Additionally the guild shop provides some units on a monthly cycle for :ef_gc: 4400.

**7\* Units require their paired pet at least at 1\* and are acquired by evolving the relevant 5\* unit twice**. More information here <https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/677592829119168512/692286207924895744/Evolving_7_Star_Units.png>
