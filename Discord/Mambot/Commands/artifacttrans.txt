.acr !artifacttrans %user% typed `!artifacttrans`. This is an overview of artifact transcendence. Artifact Transcendence significantly increases the power of 5\*/6\*/7\* artifacts. Transcending 5\* artifacts is considered a waste. Transcending requires a selection of units which are consumed. A random artifact is then transcended.

Bonuses and maximum level of artifact are increased, as well as set bonus if you have enough transcended artifacts inside a set. 

__**Restrictions**__

There is a limit to how many artifacts can be transcended per day, this varies by artifact grade, but is generally only 1 or 2. Additionally, you require a set amount of artifacts before proceeding, for example:

You need 20 6\* T0 artifacts to begin transcending.
You need 44 6\* T1 artifacts to begin transcending.
You need 15 7\* artifacts to begin transcending.
You need 15 8\* artifacts to begin transcending.

Currently the limits are:

5\* - T2
6\* - T3
7\* - T3
8\* - T2

__**Units to consider saving**__

Any unit that provides a beneficial passive is recommend to preserve, but this is not always possible.

__**Artifact Max Levels**__
The base maximum level of artifacts is dependent on their grade and transcend level. This is then improved by other mechanics.
