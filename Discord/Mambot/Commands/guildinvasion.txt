This is an overview of guild invasion

**Overview**
Guild Invasion runs over a period of 4 days, with every guild member receiving 2 tickets per day. It consists of a map of enemies that must be explored by clearing the tiles. Each tile is rated for a level. The higher the level, the more difficult the stage. Generally players are able to clear stages around their own knight level, this varies based on pets unlocked.

Additionally, stages also provide stars. Each star increases overall score by 1%. Generally stars are assigned based on their level:

Level 300+ - 1\*
Level 380+ - 2\*
Level 460+ - 3\*
Level 540+ - 4\*
Level 600+ - 5\*

Once a stage has been cleared it can be enhanced and cleared up to 3 more times. Each enhance increases the level of the stage by 50. If this pushes the stage into a new star bracket, this is awarded.

Some stages additionally provide bonus, red stars. These are treated as normal stars.

**Team Setup**
The team relies on units from the time shop and NOT the guild barracks. As such generally take the higher transcended units available. A good general team to aim for it:
```
Shadow Knight    Skeleton Warrior (unless flying then Warlock)
War Bear Rider   Orc Wing
Valkyrie         Musketeer
High Fairy       High Elf Archer
High Fairy       Poison Archer
```
For spells it is down to preference, 3 heals for survivability can be popular, but some put in 1 or 2 fast swords in place of the heals.
