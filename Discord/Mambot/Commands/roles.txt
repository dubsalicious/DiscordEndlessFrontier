 **__For guild application and ToT help__**
You need to get a server role (1/6/12/17/20)
To check your server: go to options in the game and check the number in the top-right between '(' and ')' - my info
Go to #commands  and key in `.iam server xx` **xx** is your server number

Then apply at your respective channels:
#s1_guild_recruitment 
#s6_guild_recruitment 
#s12_guild_recruitment 
#s17_guild_recruitment 
#s20_guild_recruitment 

**__To do before asking questions (KL100 and above)__**
Set your Knight Level Role by going to #commands and typing `.iam KL xx`
For example, if you are KL 420 (Ingame: Number next to your current Knight Portrait), you would type `.iam KL 400`
For an Overview of available roles, please refer to the pinned Message in #commands
