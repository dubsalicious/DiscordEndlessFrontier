Hello {{.User.Username}}, welcome to the Endless Frontier discord server! 

__**Server Rules**__

Make sure to read through the Rules Channel `#rules`. Make sure to learn about the Ticket and Warning System.

__**Server Usage Guide**__

*Looking for a guild, help with the Tower of Trials or just want to Chat to People on your Server?*

Grant yourself a server role using `.iam Server #` in `#commands`. This will make some server specific channels for your server appear.

*Knight Level Roles*

You can set yourself a role corresponding to your highest Knight Level reached in the Game by using .iam KL # in `#commands`. For available Stage roles, check the pinned message in channel `#commands`. For example, if your Knight Level is 245 type `.iam KL 200`

*Want to chat to other players?*

If it's about the game use `#ef_general`, anything else can go in `#offtopic`. 

*After some help?*

Check the `Endless Resources` Channel Category for channels about different parts of the game. In those you can find guides and useful links about almost every aspect of the game.
Ask any questions you have in `#ask_anything`, someone is normally around to help. We've also got a bunch of guides, type `!commands` in `#commands` for a full list.
Don't forget to check `#book` for detailed info about pets, artifacts, units and more.
