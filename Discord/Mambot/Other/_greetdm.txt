.greetdmmsg Hello, %user%, welcome to the Endless Frontier discord server! 

__**Server Rules**__

Make sure to read through the Rules Channel `#rules`. Make sure to learn about the Support Channel and the warning System.

__**Server Usage Guide**__

*Looking for a guild, help with the Tower of Trials or just want to Chat to People on your Server?*

Grant yourself a server role using `.iam Server #` in `#commands`. This will make some server specific channels for your server appear.

*Stage Roles*

You can set yourself a role corresponding to your highest Stage reached in the Game by using .iam Stage # in `#commands`. Check for available Stage roles in channel `#commands`. For example, if your highest Stage is 5750, you would type `.iam Stage 5000`.

*Want to chat to other players?*

If it's about the game use `#ef_general`, anything else can go in `#offtopic`. 

*After some help?*

Check `#resources` for a compilation of guides and useful links about almost every aspect of the game.
Ask any questions you have in `#ask_anything`, someone is normally around to help. We've also got a bunch of guides, type `!commands` in `#commands` for a full list.
Don't forget to check `#book` for detailed info about pets, artifacts, units and more.
